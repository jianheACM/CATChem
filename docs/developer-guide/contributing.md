## Getting Started

### 1. Development Environment Setup

**Prerequisites:**
- Modern Fortran compiler (Intel 2019+, GNU 9+)
- MPI implementation (OpenMPI, Intel MPI)
- NetCDF-Fortran and HDF5 libraries
- CMake 3.15+
- Git

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NOAA-GSL/CATChem.git
cd CATChem

# Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Set up build environment
module load intel/2021.3.0 impi/2021.3.0 netcdf/4.7.4
export FC=mpiifort CC=mpiicc CXX=mpiicpc

# Build in debug mode
mkdir build-debug && cd build-debug
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DTESTING=ON
make -j 8
```

### 2. Code Style and Standards

**Fortran Coding Standards:**
```fortran
! Module naming: PascalCase with _Mod suffix
module ProcessInterface_Mod
  use precision_mod, only: wp
  implicit none
  private

  ! Type naming: PascalCase
  type, public :: ProcessInterface
    private
    character(len=:), allocatable :: name
    logical :: initialized = .false.
  contains
    ! Procedure naming: snake_case
    procedure :: init => process_init
    procedure :: run => process_run
    procedure :: finalize => process_finalize
  end type

contains

  ! Subroutine/function naming: snake_case
  subroutine process_init(this, config, error_msg)
    class(ProcessInterface), intent(inout) :: this
    type(config_type), intent(in) :: config
    character(len=*), intent(out) :: error_msg

    ! Variable naming: snake_case
    integer :: status_code
    logical :: is_valid

    ! Constants: UPPER_CASE
    real(wp), parameter :: DEFAULT_TOLERANCE = 1.0e-6_wp

  end subroutine process_init

end module ProcessInterface_Mod
```

**Documentation Standards:**
```fortran
!> @brief Process interface for atmospheric chemistry processes
!>
!> This module provides the base interface that all atmospheric processes
!> must implement. It defines the lifecycle methods (init, run, finalize)
!> and provides common functionality.
!>
!> @author Your Name
!> @date 2024-01-15
!> @version 2.1.0
module ProcessInterface_Mod

  !> @brief Base type for all atmospheric processes
  !>
  !> All processes must extend this type and implement the required
  !> procedures. The type provides:
  !> - Lifecycle management (initialization, execution, cleanup)
  !> - Configuration handling
  !> - Error reporting
  !> - Diagnostic output
  type, public :: ProcessInterface

    !> Process name for identification and logging
    character(len=:), allocatable :: name

  contains

    !> @brief Initialize the process
    !> @param[in] config Configuration object
    !> @param[out] error_msg Error message if initialization fails
    procedure :: init => process_init

  end type

end module ProcessInterface_Mod
```

### 3. Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests:**
```fortran
! All new code must include unit tests
program test_my_process
  use MyProcess_Mod
  use testing_mod
  implicit none

  call test_init()
  call test_run()
  call test_edge_cases()
  call test_error_handling()

contains

  subroutine test_init()
    type(MyProcess) :: process
    character(len=256) :: error_msg

    call process%init(default_config, error_msg)
    call assert_true(process%initialized, "Process should be initialized")
    call assert_equals("", trim(error_msg), "No error message expected")
  end subroutine

end program
```

**Integration Tests:**
```bash
# Tests must pass on multiple systems
cd tests
./run_integration_tests.sh
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue-Driven Development

**Before Starting:**
1. **Check existing issues** - Look for related work
2. **Create or comment on issue** - Describe your planned contribution
3. **Get feedback** - Discuss approach with maintainers
4. **Plan implementation** - Break down into manageable pieces

### 2. Branch Strategy

**Branch Naming:**
- `feature/descriptive-name` - New features
- `bugfix/issue-number-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/topic-name` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring

**Example:**
```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/multiphase-chemistry

# Bug fix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-123-memory-leak

# Documentation branch
git checkout -b docs/process-generator-tutorial
```
